# Separation of Concerns

When writing code, you shouldn't mix different purposes or tasks within the same class or function. These purposes, known as concerns, should be kept separate for better organization and understanding.
Following the Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle involves extracting these concerns into specialized units, making the code more focused, easier to understand, and improving testability.

The SoC is closely related to the Single Responsibility principle, and both contribute to creating well-organized and maintainable code.

In conclusion, separation of concerns is a principle used in programming to separate an application into units, with minimal overlapping between the functions of the individual units.
