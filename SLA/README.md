# Single Level of Abstraction

When writing code, it's important to keep things at the same level of complexity within a specific part of the code. For example, assigning a value to a variable is simpler than making a method call, and mixing these different levels in one place can make the code harder to understand.

So, it's recommended to separate simpler tasks, like variable assignments, from more complex ones, like method calls, for better clarity.

**Without Single Level of Abstraction (SLA):**
Imagine you're trying to explain the process of making a sandwich, and you start with details like describing the molecular structure of the bread, the precise angle to cut the lettuce, and the chemical composition of mayonnaise. This would overwhelm the listener with unnecessary details and make the process confusing.

**With Single Level of Abstraction (SLA):**
Now, let's apply SLA. Instead of diving into molecular details, you start by explaining the overall steps in making a sandwich: selecting bread, adding ingredients, and putting it together. Once you've provided this high-level overview, you can go into more detail on each step individually, such as spreading mayonnaise or stacking the lettuce.

In this analogy, the high-level steps represent a single level of abstraction, making the explanation clearer and more manageable. Similarly, in coding, maintaining a consistent level of abstraction within a method helps make the code more readable and understandable by separating higher-level logic from lower-level details.
