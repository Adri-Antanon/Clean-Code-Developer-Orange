# Single Responsibility Principle

A class or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility or task.

In the examples, without SRP, a class or component handles multiple responsibilities. With SRP, responsibilities are separated into distinct classes or functions, making the code more modular and adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
